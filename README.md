===================

This repository holds all the code for a series of lectures held at 
The University of the Phillipines in Lahug, Cebu. The lectures focus
on using Python as a language for making computer games. Pygame 1.9.x
is the only requirement to run this code. The code goes though multiple
phases of design and abstraction and builds a SHUMP game from scratch.
