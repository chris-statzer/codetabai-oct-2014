A cool python game programming competition:

Things to add to your game:
* Lives
* Powerups
* Enemies shooting
* Homing missiles
* Give sprites a reference to the sprite manager so they can add their own
  sprites to the groups (for example a ship adding its own bullet)
* Give sprites a 'collide' method of their own that you can call
  on a collision to do some more fine grained actions.
* extend the getters/setters to allow a .children property so you can have 
  groups of sprites that move together (like engine animation or particles
  on the engines)
* A menu system for starting and stopping the gamestate and pause
* Online high-score reporting
